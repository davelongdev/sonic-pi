This is a repo for my sonic pi files.  I've recently started learning about sonic pi and writing some music with code.

# About Sonic Pi

Sonic Pi is an application that allows for the creation of music using code.  It's written mostly in Ruby and C++.  It allows for the creation of static musical compisitions as well as live coding improvised performances.  It provides functionality that's similar in many ways to a digital audio workstation (DAW).  It's built on top of the SuperCollider audio synthesis engine.
